These three Wordle attempts summarise the three topics of my PhD research: \n\n  1) designing diagnostic plots for projection pursuit optimisation, applied to guided **tour**, \n  2) developing a spatio-temporal data structure in R and using **glyph** maps to visualise the data, and \n  3) proposing a data pipeline approach under the tidy framework to construct **indexes**.\n\nSurprisingly (and hopefully), the last two words turned out to be actual  Wordle solutions: \"glyph” on 18th November 2022, and “index” on 15th August 2023 - just a few days before the submission deadline! Realising today's Wordle solution is what I've been working on daily feels like stumbling upon the crossword clue “corolla leaf\" 🌸, or in a more recent analogy, spotting the Adélie penguins in the Sea Life 🐧. \n\nTo see what I have been working on for the past 3.5 years, you can check out my thesis at <https://sherryzhang-thesis.netlify.app/>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](wordle.png){fig-align='center' width=451 height=20%}\n:::\n:::\n",
