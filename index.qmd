I'm Sherry, a third year PhD student at Monash University supervised by [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/), [Patricia Menéndez](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/patricia-menendez-galvan), [Ursula Laa](https://uschilaa.github.io/), and [Nicolas Langrené](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/nicolaslangrene/en). My research focuses on exploring multivariate spatio-temporal data. One of my projects focuses on a multivariate methods, projection pursuit. I have designed a few visual diagnostic plots to understand the optimisation in the projection pursuit algorithm in a package called [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn). Another project of mine creates a S3 class, [cubble](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/cubble), to organise and wrangle spatio-temporal data.

I have tutored various units in Monash's [Master of Business Analytics](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2021/business-analytics-b6022) program including ETC5510 Introduction to data analysis, ETC5512 Wild-caught data, and ETC5521 Exploratory Data analysis. This year, I'm the organiser of [Monash NUMBATs](https://numbat.space/) seminar, see the event calendar for some of the past events.
