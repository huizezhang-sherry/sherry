I'm Sherry, a final year PhD student at Monash University supervised by [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/), [Patricia Menéndez](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/patricia-menendez-galvan), [Ursula Laa](https://uschilaa.github.io/), and [Nicolas Langrené](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/nicolaslangrene/en). My research provides data wrangling and visualisation tools for analysing multivariate spatio-temporal data. One of my projects, [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn), focuses on creating diagnostic plots to understand the optimisers in projection pursuit, a multivariate dimension reduction method. I have also been working on a spatio-temporal data class, [cubble](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/cubble) (cubical-tibble), to help with data wrangling and making glyph maps.
