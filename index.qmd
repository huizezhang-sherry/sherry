I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, working with [Roger Peng](https://rdpeng.org/). I received my PhD from Monash University in Australia in 2023 under the supervision of [Dianne Cook](https://www.dicook.org/), [Patricia Menéndez](https://www.patriciamenendez.com/about/), [Ursula Laa](https://uschilaa.github.io/), and [Nicolas Langrené](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/nicolaslangrene/en). My research focuses on making applied statistical analysis both easier and more robust by contributing to open source software and developing data analysis theory.

<!-- One of my projects, [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn), focuses on creating diagnostic plots to understand the optimisers in projection pursuit, a multivariate dimension reduction method. I have also been working on a spatio-temporal data class, [cubble](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/cubble) (cubical-tibble), to help with data wrangling and making glyph maps. -->
