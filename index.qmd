I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin with [Roger Peng](https://rdpeng.org/). I received my PhD from Monash University in 2023 and my area of research is on providing data wrangling and visualisation tools for analysing multivariate spatio-temporal data.

<!-- One of my projects, [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn), focuses on creating diagnostic plots to understand the optimisers in projection pursuit, a multivariate dimension reduction method. I have also been working on a spatio-temporal data class, [cubble](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/cubble) (cubical-tibble), to help with data wrangling and making glyph maps. -->
