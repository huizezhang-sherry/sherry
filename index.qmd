I am a final year PhD candidate at Monash University. My research provides data wrangling and visualisation tools for analysing multivariate spatio-temporal data. In 2024, I will join the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at University of Texas, Austin as a postdoctoral research fellow.

<!--# supervised by Di Cook, Patricia Menéndez, Ursula Laa, and Nicolas Langrené.  -->

<!-- One of my projects, [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn), focuses on creating diagnostic plots to understand the optimisers in projection pursuit, a multivariate dimension reduction method. I have also been working on a spatio-temporal data class, [cubble](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/cubble) (cubical-tibble), to help with data wrangling and making glyph maps. -->
