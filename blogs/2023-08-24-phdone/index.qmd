I submitted my thesis! These three Wordle attempts summarise the three topics of my PhD research:

1)  designing diagnostic plots for projection pursuit optimisation, applied to guided **tour**,
2)  developing a spatio-temporal data structure in R and using **glyph** maps to visualise the data, and
3)  proposing a data pipeline approach under the tidy framework to construct **indexes**.

Surprisingly (and hopefully), the last two words turned out to be actual Wordle solutions: "glyph" on 18th November 2022, and "index" on 15th August 2023 - just a few days before the submission deadline! Realising today's Wordle solution is what I've been working on daily feels like stumbling upon the crossword clue "corolla leaf" `r set.seed(123); emo::ji("flower")`, or in a more recent analogy, spotting the Ad√©lie penguins in the Sea Life `r emo::ji("penguin")`.

To see what I have been working on for the past 3.5 years, you can check out my thesis at <https://sherryzhang-thesis.netlify.app/>
