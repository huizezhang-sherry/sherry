<!-- Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. (examples). I developed a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. This allows to compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes' robustness. -->

## Visual Diagnostics for Constrained Optimisation with Application to Guided Tours [{{< fa file-pdf >}}](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2021-105/) [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn)

Projection pursuit is a technique used to find interesting low-dimensional linear projections of high dimension data by optimising an index function on projection matrices. I don't expect what I just said to fully make sense to you, so let's instead think about cutting double yolk mooncake:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("projection-pursuit.png")
```

I hope you can see that the index function can become quiet complex if the data dimension increases. In fact, the index function could be non-linear, computationally expensive to calculate the gradient, and may have local optima, which are also interesting for projection pursuit to explore. This work has designed four diagnostic plots to visualise the optimisation routine in projection pursuit, and @fig-diag-plot is one of them, plotting two optimisation paths in a 5D unit sphere space.
