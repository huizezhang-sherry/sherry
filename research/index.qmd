## Research

Statistics has evolved to address complex research questions that often require integrating multiple data sources. This evolution places greater demands on data preparation, exploration, and visualization prior to confirmatory analysis. Modern data analysis also drives the development of statistical software that capable of supporting fast, yet comprehensive, exploratory tasks across diverse data types, including spatial, temporal, imageries, and text data. My research focuses on two main areas:

1) developing methods and software tools for exploring and visualizing multivariate and spatio-temporal data, and
2) building the theoretical foundations for constructing general-purpose tools for practical data analysis.


## An LLM-based pipeline for understanding decision choices in data analysis from published literature

Decision choices, such as those made when building regression models, and their rationale are essential for interpreting results and understanding uncertainty in data analysis. However, these decisions are rarely studied because tracing every alternatives considered by authors is often impractical. Researchers often manually review large bodies of published analyses to identify common choices and understand how these choices are made. In this work, I propose a workflow to automatically extract analytic decisions and their reasons from published literature using Large Language Models. I  also introduce a paper similarity measure based on decision similarity and visualization methods using clustering algorithms. This workflow is applied to understand decision choices in the association of daily particulate matter and daily mortality in air pollution modeling literature. This approach enables scalable and automated studies of decision choices in applied data analysis given the recent advnace of LLMs, providing an alternative to existing qualitative and interview-based studies. *This work is currently under review for 2026 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.*  [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/paper-decisions)

#| fig-cap: "The workflow for extracting decisions from published literature using Large Language Models (LLMs) and analyzing the extracted decisions. The workflow consists of four main steps: (1) Extract decisions automatically from literature with LLMs, (2) Validate and standardize LLM outputs, (3) Calculate paper similarity and visualization, and (4) Visualize with clustering or dimension reduction methods."

## A tidy framework and infrastructure to systematically assemble spatio-temporal indexes from multivariate data 

Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into a single metric for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, most indexes are not designed and implemented in a way that makes it easy to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. I developed a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes, and it allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes' robustness. @fig-idx-tour shows the Global Gender Gap Index, comprised of four dimensions (economy, education, health, and politics) in a linear combination with equal weights of 0.25. The tour animation shows how the index value and country ranking changes as the weight assigned to the politics dimension changes. *This work has been published in Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.* [{{< fa file-pdf >}}](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2024.2374960) [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/tidyindex)


```{r fig-idx-tour, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Exploring the sensitivity of the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), by varying the politics component’s contribution. Bangladesh’s GGGI increases substantially when politics gains more weights, indicating that this component plays a large role in it’s relatively high value. Also, politics plays a substantial role in the GGGI’s for the top ranked countries, because each of them drops, to the state of being similar to the middle ranked countries when the politics component’s contribution is reduced."

## cubble: An R Package for Organizing and Wrangling Multivariate Spatio-temporal Data 

For many analyses, spatial and time components can be separately studied: for example, to explore the temporal trend of one variable for a single spatial location, or to model the spatial distribution of one variable at a given time. However for others, it is important to analyze different aspects of the spatio-temporal data simultaneously, for instance, temporal trends of multiple variables across locations. In order to facilitate the study of different portions or combinations of spatio-temporal data, we introduce a new class, cubble, with a suite of functions enabling easy slicing and dicing on different spatio-temporal components. @fig-glyphmap is created by analyzing the daily maximum temperature data form Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) across stations in two Australia states, using the cubble data structure and the glyph maps are created using the `geom_glyph()` function, also implemented in the cubble package, as follows: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
tmax |>
  ggplot(aes(x_major = long, x_minor = month, y_major = lat, y_minor = tmax, ...)) +
  geom_sf(..., inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_glyph_box(...) +
  geom_glyph(...) +
  ...
```
  

```{r fig-glyphmap, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-cap: "Glyph maps comparing temperature change between 1971-1975 and 2016-2020 for 54 stations in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. Overlaid line plots show monthly temperature (a) where a hint of late summer warming can be seen. Transforming to temperature differences (c) shows pronounced changes between the two periods. The horizontal guideline marks zero difference. One station, Cobar, is highlighted in the glyph maps and shown separately (b, d). Here the late summer (Jan-Feb) warming pattern, which is more prevalent at inland locations, is clear."

## Visual Diagnostics for Constrained Optimisation with Application to Guided Tours 

Projection pursuit is a technique used to find interesting low-dimensional linear projections of high dimension data by optimizing an index function on projection matrices. The index function could be non-linear, computationally expensive to calculate the gradient, and may have local optima, which are also interesting for projection pursuit to explore. This work has designed four diagnostic plots to visualize the optimisation routine in projection pursuit, and @fig-diag-plot is one of them, plotting two optimisation paths in a 5D unit sphere space. *This work has been published in the R Journal.* [{{< fa file-pdf >}}](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2021-105/) [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn)
